# Manim-gui 

![screencap](screencap.png)

Low-capability GUI for Manim, primarily for generating preset scenes.  Currently, there are a measly three scenes to choose from, but I'll be working on expanding and classifying those in the near future.

# Instructions

1. Clone `manimgui` into your Manim directory.
2. Open `manimgui.py` and edit the string `MANIM_DIRECTORY` to reflect your Manim directory.
3. Execute `manimgui.py`.

# Changelog

### Version 0.1.1 (current): 
- using pathlib now, should work on both Mac and Windows

### Version 0.1.0:
