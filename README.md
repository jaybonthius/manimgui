# Manim-gui 

![screencap](screencap.png)

Low-capability GUI for Manim, primarily for generating preset scenes.  Currently, there are a measly three scenes to choose from, but I'll be working on expanding and classifying those in the near future.

# Instructions

1. Clone `manimgui` into your Manim directory.
2. Open `gui.py` and edit the string `DIRECTORY` to reflect your Manim directory.
3. Execute `gui.py`.

This was written on Windows, and since Windows uses backslashes for paths, Mac and Linux users might have to tinker with the slashes a bit.  I'll work on fixing this in the future.

# Changelog

### Version 0.1.0 (current): 
- initialization
