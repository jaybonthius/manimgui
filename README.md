# Manim-gui 

![screencap](screencap.png)

Low-capability GUI for Manim, primarily for generating preset scenes.  Currently, there are a measly three scenes to choose from, but I'll be working on expanding and classifying those in the near future.

# Instructions

1. Clone `manimgui` into your Manim directory.
2. Open `gui.py` and edit the string `DIRECTORY` to reflect your Manim directory.
3. Execute `gui.py`.

# Changelog

### Version 0.1.0 (current):
